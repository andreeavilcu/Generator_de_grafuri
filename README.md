  # Graph Generator and MST Visualizer
This project is an interactive application for graph generation and visualization. It allows users to create directed graphs using the Erdős-Rényi model and compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's, Prim's, and Borůvka's algorithms. The application features an intuitive graphical user interface and offers functionalities such as layout switching, MST edge highlighting, zooming, and displaying graph attributes.

  Technologies used:
  
    •Python – main programming language
    
    •Tkinter – for building the graphical user interface (GUI)
    
    •NetworkX – for graph generation and analysis
    
    •Matplotlib – for interactive graph visualization
    
    •Random – for probabilistic edge generation in graphs
